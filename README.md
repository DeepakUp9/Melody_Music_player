A Major project to make Homepage and single playlist page for a Melody Music PLayer website like Spotify but it uses  only HTML and CSS (can latter use JS on it).


Main Homepage of the website is index.html and styling for the this html is done by external css called stylesheet.css and for the Playlist page html is Single Playlist Screen.html and styling css is Single Playlist Screen Style.css and there are two more css files those for to make the pages more responsive and I don't think that you need to touch those and all the media(images) required for these pages are in the "media.zip" you need to extract this file.

index.html uses stylesheet_main.css for all the basic styling and primary page responsive.css for all the meida queries related to responsiveness.
Similarly Single Playlist Screen.html uses Single Playlist Screen Styles.css for all the basic styling and Secondary page responsive.css for all the meida queries related to responsiveness.
